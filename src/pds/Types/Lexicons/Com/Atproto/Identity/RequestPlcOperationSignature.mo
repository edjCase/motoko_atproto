  /// This is an unusual endpoint that has no input parameters and no output response.
  /// It simply triggers the server to send an email with a code that can be used
  /// to request a signed PLC operation.
  ///
  /// Endpoint Details:
  /// - Type: procedure
  /// - Authentication: Required
  /// - Input: None (no parameters)
  /// - Output: None (no response body)
  ///
  /// Usage Flow:
  /// 1. Call this endpoint (authenticated) to request a signature token
  /// 2. Server sends email with verification code/token
  /// 3. Use the token from email in com.atproto.identity.signPlcOperation
  ///
  /// Since this endpoint has no request/response types, there are no Motoko types
  /// or JSON conversion functions to define.

  // Empty module - this endpoint requires no type definitions
